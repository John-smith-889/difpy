## DifPy

Python package for information diffusion investigation in social networks.
DifPy is in early development stage.


### Requirements

DifPy is based mostly on NumPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib libraries.
Also contemporary version of Python 3.7 + is needed.
It works well in 2019.03 Anaconda environment. 


### Installation

DifPy is available directly from the Github repository. To install DifPy,
git installed on your local machine is needed.


#### You may install DifPy on your local machine with the line below:

```sh
$ pip install git+git://github.com/John-smith-889/difpy.git
```

#### And import with the line below:

```python
import difpy as dp
```

### Tutorials

Simple Jupyter notebook example of DifPy usage you may find in present
repository under name 'difpy_case_pl.ipynb'.

As far package has been used to educational purposes on Warsaw School of Economics on Multi-agent Modelling laboratories.
Script from labs you may fork [here](https://github.com/KrainskiL/MW_L1920/tree/master/Zajecia2).


### Documentation

To read about DifPy functions you may look into 
functions' docstrings written in numpy style.

To read more you may look also at an 
[article](https://john-smith-889.github.io/blog/social%20network%20analysis/difpy-diffusion-on-graphs-in-python-PL.html)
about the package on the blog.
