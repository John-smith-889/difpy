## DifPy

Python package for information diffusion investigation in social networks.
DifPy is in early development stage.


### Requirements

DifPy is based mostly on NumPy, NetworkX, Matplotlib libraries.
Also contemporary version of Python 3.7 + is needed.
It works well in 2019.03 Anaconda environment. 


### Installation

DifPy is available directly from the Github repository. To install DifPy,
git installed on your local machine is needed.


#### You may install DifPy on your local machine with the line below:

```sh
$ pip install git+git://github.com/John-smith-889/difpy.git
```

#### And import with the line below:

```python
import difpy as dp
```

### Licence

MIT

### To do
* Additional optimization metaheuristics functions
* Additional methods of computing diffusion speed
* Implement paralell computing for better performance
* Extend unit tests fot better code coverage
* Test big size networks 1 million + nodes
* Extended documentation 
* Examples of code usage

### Done
* simulation module
* optimization module
* modelling and feature importance module
